# Face Verification Using Siamese Networks and Triplet Loss
Implemented a Siamese Network using triplet loss to perform face verification on the LFW dataset.
Images were preprocessed and embedded via a custom CNN, enabling identity verification by comparing facial similarity based on learned feature representations.
